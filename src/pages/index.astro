                        <p>Hi üëãüèª, I'm Patrick, the owner of Cascade Development.</p>
                        <p>I have over 8 years commercial experience in Web Development, specifically the ecommerce space.</p>
                        <p>I'm a certified Magento 2 developer and have been fortunate enough to work with global brands such as Brandon Hire Station, National Trust, Screwfix and more.</p>
                        <p>I'm a firm believer that every business should have some form of online presence. A website is the best place to start.</p>
                        <p>If you haven't got a website, or you have one that's slow, painful and a general mess, look no further. <a href="/contact">Let's talk!</a></p>
